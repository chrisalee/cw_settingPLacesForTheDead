The Hall
You are a servant in The Great Hall of Ghosts. The purpose of this place is to hold the Day of Passing ceremony in honor of the deceased members of your society. The hall was carved directly out of the mountain rock to house a majestic square Grand Table surrounded by twelve magnificent Seats of Honor. Each corner of the hall is adorned by one of the four Culturally Significant Features. Going clockwise around the table, they are; a comforting arrangement of earthenware holding exotic plants in lucious soil, a natural waterfall of gentle sounds and sweet moisture, a roaring fireplace of tremendous warmth, and a breezy windowsill open to the freshest of air.

The Dead
Every morning, the Elders give you a List of the Dead naming people who throughout the past had died on that date, although a person's name is only included on the list if currently living members of society have made any donations in their name for this year.

Your Task
The obligation in service to which you are assigned in the Great Hall is to set out the places in preparation for the ceremonial dinner at the Grand Table every evening, and the most important part of this task is to figure out exactly which Ghosts should sit at which Seats amongst the twelve!

The seating arrangement will be based on the order in which they appear on your list and the most favored Culturally Significant Feature of each particular ghost. Their favorite feature is devised by using the initial letter of their name and the Four Ancient Names of the corner features:

they favor Earthenware if their first initial is one of the letters in the name "QUTHCRDMZ"
they favor Waterfall if their first initial is one of the letters in the name "WEVOXING"
they favor Fireplace if their first initial is one of the letters in the name "JFABKPLY"
they favor Windowsill if their first initial is one of the letters in the name "SSSSSSSSS"
For the names on the list, one at a time, they each get an opportunity to be seated as close as possible to the corner they desire the most. Whenever there are two seats that are equidistant from the preferred corner seat, the ghost will always take the seat which is counter-clockwise to that corner.

As the table gradually fills up, those later on the list will have fewer and notably less attractive seating options from which to choose.

Depending on how many names made the list this year, there will often be days when there are too many ghosts to be seated, and only the first twelve can be seated. On other days there could be a number of empty seats if there were fewer applicants. In this case, those empty seats should be represented by a string of five underscores ("_____") in lieu of the name of a ghost.

An Example
Given this List of the Dead to be tasked with seating the Grand Table:

the_dead = ['Yojne', 'Xenna', 'Verap', 'Ebyam', 'Teseb', 'Ycuag', 'Onets', 'Skcaw', 'Yrovi', 'Tpets', 'Lizuf', 'Girnu']
The first name on the list is Yojne. Because their name starts with the letter Y, they are of the JFABKPLY clan and therefore want to sit as close as possible to the Fireplace. As the table is completely empty, they will get their first choice, and be assigned to Seat 7:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( __1__ ) ( __2__ ) ( __3__ ) ( __4__ )

     ( _12__ )                     ( __5__ )

     ( _11__ )                     ( __6__ )

     ( _10__ ) ( __9__ ) ( __8__ ) ( Yojne )

 Windowsill                             Fireplace
Next on the list is Xenna, who with the first letter X hails from the WEVOXING family and thus favors the Waterfall, and they also get their first choice in Seat 4:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( __1__ ) ( __2__ ) ( __3__ ) ( Xenna )

     ( _12__ )                     ( __5__ )

     ( _11__ )                     ( __6__ )

     ( _10__ ) ( __9__ ) ( __8__ ) ( Yojne )

 Windowsill                             Fireplace
Third on the list is Verap, who also has the Waterfall as their favorite feature, but since Xenna is sitting in the corner seat, Verap will have to take the next best option, which is a seat nearest to that corner.

Here we have a case of two equidistant options; the two seats that are closest to the Waterfall are Seat 3 and Seat 5. Verap's ghost will be seated at Seat 3 because it is counter-clockwise from Seat 4 in the corner:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( __1__ ) ( __2__ ) ( Verap ) ( Xenna )

     ( _12__ )                     ( __5__ )

     ( _11__ )                     ( __6__ )

     ( _10__ ) ( __9__ ) ( __8__ ) ( Yojne )

 Windowsill                             Fireplace
Fourth in order we get Ebyam, and in also favoring the Waterfall, takes Seat 5:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( __1__ ) ( __2__ ) ( Verap ) ( Xenna )

     ( _12__ )                     ( Ebyam )

     ( _11__ )                     ( __6__ )

     ( _10__ ) ( __9__ ) ( __8__ ) ( Yojne )

 Windowsill                             Fireplace
Fifth is Teseb of the QUTHCRDMZ leaning, and easily takes the Earthenware corner seat:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( Teseb ) ( __2__ ) ( Verap ) ( Xenna )

     ( _12__ )                     ( Ebyam )

     ( _11__ )                     ( __6__ )

     ( _10__ ) ( __9__ ) ( __8__ ) ( Yojne )

 Windowsill                             Fireplace
Sixth is Ycuag who will want to be near the Fireplace, so they take Seat 6:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( Teseb ) ( __2__ ) ( Verap ) ( Xenna )

     ( _12__ )                     ( Ebyam )

     ( _11__ )                     ( Ycuag )

     ( _10__ ) ( __9__ ) ( __8__ ) ( Yojne )

 Windowsill                             Fireplace
Onets comes along in seventh place and also favors the very popular Waterfall. They take the best choice remaining which is Seat 2:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( Teseb ) ( Onets ) ( Verap ) ( Xenna )

     ( _12__ )                     ( Ebyam )

     ( _11__ )                     ( Ycuag )

     ( _10__ ) ( __9__ ) ( __8__ ) ( Yojne )

At last, we get a member of the Windowsill fan club in eighth place. Skcaw readily takes that corner at Seat 10:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( Teseb ) ( Onets ) ( Verap ) ( Xenna )

     ( _12__ )                     ( Ebyam )

     ( _11__ )                     ( Ycuag )

     ( Skcaw ) ( __9__ ) ( __8__ ) ( Yojne )

 Windowsill                             Fireplace
Ninth appears Yrovi, who wants to be near the Fireplace, and takes Seat 8:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( Teseb ) ( Onets ) ( Verap ) ( Xenna )

     ( _12__ )                     ( Ebyam )

     ( _11__ )                     ( Ycuag )

     ( Skcaw ) ( __9__ ) ( Yrovi ) ( Yojne )

 Windowsill                             Fireplace
Tpets in ten place is an Earthenware acolyte, and takes the closest place next to that corner at Seat 12:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( Teseb ) ( Onets ) ( Verap ) ( Xenna )

     ( Tpets )                     ( Ebyam )

     ( _11__ )                     ( Ycuag )

     ( Skcaw ) ( __9__ ) ( Yrovi ) ( Yojne )

 Windowsill                             Fireplace
In eleventh place we get Lizuf of Fireplace people, and now with only two places to choose from, obviously takes Seat 9:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( Teseb ) ( Onets ) ( Verap ) ( Xenna )

     ( Tpets )                     ( Ebyam )

     ( _11__ )                     ( Ycuag )

     ( Skcaw ) ( Lizuf ) ( Yrovi ) ( Yojne )

 Windowsill                             Fireplace
The final ghost coming in at twelfth place is Girnu, yet another ghost wanting to be near the Waterfall, but they are too late on the list to get a seat close to that corner, and must be satisfied to even be at the table in Seat 11:

Earthenware                            Waterfall

     ( Teseb ) ( Onets ) ( Verap ) ( Xenna )

     ( Tpets )                     ( Ebyam )

     ( Girnu )                     ( Ycuag )

     ( Skcaw ) ( Lizuf ) ( Yrovi ) ( Yojne )

 Windowsill                             Fireplace
The table now being completely sat, we end up with a final seating arrangement in the form of a list taking the seats from the top left corner and going clockwise through the twelve seats:

seating = ['Teseb', 'Onets', 'Verap', 'Xenna', 'Ebyam', 'Ycuag', 'Yojne', 'Yrovi', 'Lizuf', 'Skcaw', 'Girnu', 'Tpets']
Input
A list (0 <= size <= 18) of names (each size == 5 chars long).

Output
A list (always size == 12) of names (or placeholders: "_____" ), representing the final seating arrangement.
